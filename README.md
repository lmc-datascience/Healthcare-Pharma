# Healthcare & Pharma – Business Intelligence Dashboard (Demo)

📊 **Overview**  
This project simulates healthcare and pharmaceutical management across a hospital network.  
The goal is to demonstrate expertise in **Power BI, DAX, data modeling, and executive storytelling** applied to the healthcare industry.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Executive Overview**: Admissions, discharges, mortality, readmission, and inpatients.  
- **Cost & Finance**: Total costs, cost per patient, medication spend, procedures.  
- **Appointments & Wait Times**: Consultations volume, waiting times, and no-show rate.  
- **Lab Performance**: Avg turnaround time (TAT), % within target, test/hospital analysis.  
- **Pharmacy & Inventory**: Stock coverage, stockouts, spend per drug category.  
- **Sustainability (ESG)**: Energy consumption, CO₂ emissions, and environmental impact by hospital.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Power BI** (DAX, Power Query, tabular modeling)  
- **SQL/CSV** (transactional data simulation)  
- **Python** (automation and synthetic dataset generation)

## 📂 Data Structure
- **Dimensions**  
  - `dim_date` → full calendar (year, month, quarter, day).  
  - `dim_patient` → patient master data.  
  - `dim_doctor` → doctor directory.  
  - `dim_hospital` → hospitals, regions, and capacity (beds).  
  - `dim_labtest` → test catalog with target turnaround time (TAT).  
  - `dim_medication` → drug catalog and unit cost.  

- **Facts**  
  - `fact_admissions` → admissions, discharges, LOS, mortality, readmission.  
  - `fact_costs` → costs per admission (total, medication, procedures).  
  - `fact_appointments` → appointments, attendance/no-show, wait times.  
  - `fact_lab_tests` → laboratory tests and turnaround times.  
  - `fact_med_inventory` → stock levels, dispensing, and stockouts.  
  - `fact_treatments` → treatments and procedures linked to admissions.  
  - `fact_energy_consumption` → energy usage and CO₂ emissions by hospital.
